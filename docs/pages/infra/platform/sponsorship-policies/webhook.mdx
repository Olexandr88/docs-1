# How to use Sponsorship Policy webhook

Webhooks are a way for you to receive real-time notifications when a sponsorship policy is triggered. You can use webhooks to trigger actions in your application when a policy is triggered. Request is sent with POST, where body is a JSON object with the following structure:

```typescript
const body = {
    type: 'sponsorshipPolicy.webhook',
    data: {
        object: {
            userOperation,
            entryPoint,
            chainId,
            sponsorshipPolicyId: sponsorshipPolicy.id    
        }
    }
};
```

The returned value will be a valid JSON with the following structure. 

```json
{
    "sponsor": true // Boolean
}
```

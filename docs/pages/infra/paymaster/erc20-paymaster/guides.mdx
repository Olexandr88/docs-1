# ERC-20 Paymaster Guides

When using Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster, the paymaster needs approval to spend funds on the payer's behalf. The amount to approve must be atleast equal to the userOperation's prefund value.

You can use the helper function below to get the required approval amount.

## Steps

::::steps
### Define imports and create the clients

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/permissioned-erc20.ts:clients]
```

### Fetch your users' token holdings

For this example, we will assume that our user only holds USDC on Base Sepolia.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/permissioned-erc20.ts:getUserTokens]
```

### Call `pimlico_getTokenQuotes` and calculate the approval amount needed for your userOperation

After calling `pimlico_getTokenQuotes`, use the returned values to calculate the approval amount for a specific userOperation by calling the paymaster's `getCostInToken`.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/permissioned-erc20.ts:getTokenQuotes]
```

### Reconstruct and send the userOperation
After finding the amount that we need to approve, we reconstruct the userOperation to include the token approval before sending it.

Ensure that the paymaster context includes a `token` field to inform the Pimlico endpoint to sponsor the userOperation using ERC-20 mode.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/permissioned-erc20.ts:sendUserOperation]
```
